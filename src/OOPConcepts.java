		 * 1 Abstraction
		 *    Triangle
		 *    Table
		 *    We know what they are, but sometimes don't know exactly which one 
		 * 2 Encapsulation
		 *    Driving a Car
		 * 3 Inheritance
		 *    Allows objects or classes to inherit from parent classes
		 * 4 Polymorphism
		 *    Animals communicate in different ways
		 *    The "Method" communicate can take different forms
		 *    
		 * Class - How we Structure our code in OOP
		 * Class like a blueprint
		 * Object is the actual product developed from the blueprint
		 * An Object is an instance of a class
		 *
